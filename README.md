This is an R package of datasets I've used to teach my Latin American politics course. The datasets are compiled from a bunch of different sources, and include data on topics such as: 

- Sale of colonial provincial offices in 17th-18th century Peru
- Varities of Democracy (V-DEM) indicators
- GDP, imports/exports, population, urbanization, etc.
- Survey data on Racial self-identification, skin-tone
- Land invasions in Brazil
- Survey data on income, household assets, and other measures of poverty

I **hope** to keep updating this project whenever I teach a new iteration of the class. 

To install:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("hail2thief/ladata")
```
